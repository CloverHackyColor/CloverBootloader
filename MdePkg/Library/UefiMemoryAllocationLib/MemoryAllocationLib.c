/**
  Allocates one or more 4KB pages of a certain memory type.

  Allocates the number of 4KB pages of a certain memory type and returns a pointer
  to the allocated buffer.  The buffer returned is aligned on a 4KB boundary.  If
  Pages is 0, then NULL is returned.   If there is not enough memory remaining to
  satisfy the request, then NULL is returned.

  @param  Type                  The type of allocation to perform.
  @param  MemoryType            The type of memory to allocate.
  @param  Pages                 The number of 4 KB pages to allocate.
  @param  Memory                The pointer to a physical address. On input, the
                                way in which the address is used depends on the
                                value of Type.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The requested pages were allocated.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER 1) Type is not AllocateAnyPages or
                                AllocateMaxAddress or AllocateAddress.
                                2) MemoryType is in the range
                                EfiMaxMemoryType..0x6FFFFFFF.
                                3) Memory is NULL.
                                4) MemoryType is EfiPersistentMemory.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  The pages could not be allocated.
  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND         The requested pages could not be found.

=head1 NAME

po4a - update both the PO files and translated documents in one shot

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<po4a> [I<options>] I<config_file>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The po4a (PO for anything) project goal is to ease translations (and more
interestingly, the maintenance of translations) using gettext tools on
areas where they were not expected like documentation.

The B<po4a> program is useful if you want to avoid calling
L<po4a-gettextize(1)>, L<po4a-updatepo(1)>, and L<po4a-translate(1)> in
complex Makefiles when you have multiple files to translate, different
format, or need to specify different options for different documents.

=head1 INTRODUCTION

The B<po4a> program is in charge of updating both the PO files (to sync
them to the original documents) and the translated documents (to sync
them to the PO files). The main point is to make the use of po4a easier
without having to remember of the command line options.

It also allows you to mix documents having different formats into the same
POT file so that you can have only one such file per project.

This behaviour can be mimicked by the other tools of the po4a suite (for
example with Makefiles), but it is rather difficult to do, and exhausting to
redo the same complicated Makefiles for each project using po4a.

The dataflow can be summarized as follow. Any changes to the master document
will be reflected in the PO files, and all changes to the PO files (either
manual or caused by previous step) will be reflected in translation
documents.

 master document --> PO files --> translations

The dataflow cannot be inversed in this tool, and changes in translations
are overwritten by the content of the PO files. As a matter of fact, this
tool cannot be used to convert existing translations to the po4a system. For
that task, please refer to L<po4a-gettextize(1)>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX

The (mandatory) argument is the path to the configuration file to use.
Its syntax aims at being simple and close to the configuration files used
by the intl-tools projects.

Comments in this files are noted by the char '#'. It comments everything
until the end of the line. Lines can be continued by escaping the end of line.
All non blank lines must begin with a [] command, followed by its arguments.
(sound difficult said that way, but it is rather easy, I hope ;)

=head2 Specifying the template languages

B<Note:> It is recommended to use B<[po_directory]> rather than B<[po4a_langs]>
and B<[po4a_paths]>.
See section B<Autodetection of the paths and languages> below.

This is an optional command that can simplify the whole config file, and will
make it more scalable. You have to specify a list of the languages in which
you want to translate the documents. This is as simple as:

 [po4a_langs] fr de

This will enable you to expand B<$lang> to all the specified languages in the rest
of the config file.

=head2 Specifying the paths to translator inputs

B<Note:> It is recommended to use B<[po_directory]> rather than B<[po4a_langs]>
and B<[po4a_paths]>.
See section B<Autodetection of the paths and languages> below.

First, you have to specify where the translator input files (i.e. the files
used by translators to do their job) are located. It can be done by such a line:

 [po4a_paths] doc/l10n/project.doc.pot \
              fr:doc/l10n/fr.po de:doc/l10n/de.po

The command is thus B<[po4a_paths]>. The first argument is the path to the POT
file to use. All subsequent arguments are of the self-explanatory form:

    <lang>:<path to the PO file for this lang>

If you've defined the template languages, you can rewrite the line above this
way:

 [po4a_paths] doc/l10n/project.doc.pot $lang:doc/l10n/$lang.po

You can also use B<$master> to refer to the document filename. In this case,
B<po4a> will use a split mode: one POT and one PO (for each language) will
be created for each document specified in the B<po4a> configuration file.
See the B<Split mode> section.

 [po4a_paths] doc/$master/$master.pot $lang:doc/$master/$lang.po

=head2 Autodetection of the paths and languages

Another command can be used to specify the name of a directory where the
PO and POT files are located.
When it is used, B<po4a> will detect the POT file as the only F<*.pot> file
from the specified directory.
B<po4a> will also use the list of F<*.po> files to define the list of
languages (by stripping out the extension).
These languages will be used for the substitution of the B<$lang> variable in
the rest of the configuration file.

This command should not be used together with the B<[po4a_langs]> or B<[po4a_paths]>
commands.

When using this command, you have to create an empty POT file on the first
invocation of B<po4a> to let it know the name of the POT file.

 [po_directory] po4a/po/

=head2 Specifying the documents to translate

You now naturally have to specify which documents are translated, their
format, and where to put the translations. It can be made by such lines:

 [type: sgml] doc/my_stuff.sgml fr:doc/fr/mon_truc.sgml \
              de:doc/de/mein_kram.sgml
 [type: pod] script fr:doc/fr/script.1 de:doc/de/script.1 \
             add_fr:doc/l10n/script.fr.add

This should be rather self-explanatory also. Note that in the second case,
F<doc/l10n/script.fr.add> is an addendum to add to the French version of this document.
Please refer to L<po4a(7)> for more information about the addenda.

More formally, the format is:

 [type: <format>] <master_doc> (<lang>:<localized_doc>)* \
                  (add_<lang>:<modifier>*<addendum_path>)*

If there is no modifier, I<addendum_path> is a path to an addendum.
Modifiers are

=over 2

=item B<?>

Include I<addendum_path> if this file does exist, otherwise do nothing.

=item B<@>

I<addendum_path> is not a regular addendum but a file containg a list of
addenda, one by line.  Each addendum may be preceded by modifiers.

=item B<!>

I<addendum_path> is discarded, it is not loaded and will not be loaded by
any further addendum specification.

=back

If you've defined the template languages, you can rewrite the line above this
way:

 [type: pod] script $lang:doc/$lang/script.1 \
             add_fr:doc/l10n/script.fr.add

If all the languages had addenda with similar paths, you could also write
something like:

 [type: pod] script $lang:doc/$lang/script.1 \
             add_$lang:doc/l10n/script.$lang.add

=head2 Specifying options for the modules

B<po4a> accepts options that will be passed to the module. These options are
module specific and are specified with the B<-o> switch.

If you need a specific option for one of the document you want to
translate, you can also specify it in the configuration file. Options are
introduced by the B<opt> keyword. The argument of the B<opt> keyword must be
quoted with double quotes if it contains a space (e.g. if you specify
multiple options, or an option with an argument).
You can also specify options that will only apply to a specific language
by using the B<opt_>I<lang> keyword.

Here is an example:
 [type:man] data-05/test2_man.1 $lang:tmp/test2_man.$lang.1 \
            opt:"-k 75" opt_it:"-L UTF-8" opt_fr:-v

Arguments may contain spaces if you use single quotes or escaped double
quotes:
 [po4a_alias:man] man opt:"-o \"mdoc=NAME,SEE ALSO\" -k 20"

If you want to specify the same options for many documents, you may want
to use an alias (see the B<Specifying aliases> section below).

You can also set options for all the documents specified in the
configuration file:
 [options] opt:"..." opt_fr:"..."

=head2 Specifying aliases

If you must specify the same options for multiple files, you may be
interested in defining a module alias. This can be done this way:

 [po4a_alias:test] man opt:"-k 21" opt_es:"-o debug=splitargs"

This defines a module alias named B<test>, based on the B<man> module, with
the B<-k 21> applied to all the languages and with B<-o debug=splitargs>
applied to the Spanish translation.

This module alias can then be use like a regular module:

 [type:test] data-05/test2_man.1 $lang:tmp/test2_man.$lang.1 \
            opt_it:"-L UTF-8" opt_fr:-v

Note that you can specify additional options on a per file basis.

=head2 Split mode

The split mode is used when B<$master> is used in the B<[po4a_paths]> line.

When the split mode is used, a temporary big POT and temporary big POs
are used. This permits to share the translations between all the POs.

If two POs have different translations for the same string, B<po4a> will mark
this string as fuzzy and will submit both translations in all the POs
which contain this string. Then, when a translator updates the translation
and removes the fuzzy tag in one PO, the translation of this string will
be updated in every POs automatically.

If there are name conflicts because several files have the same filename,
the name of the master file can be specified by adding a C<master:file=>I<name>
option:

 [po4a_langs] de fr ja
 [po4a_paths] l10n/po/$master.pot $lang:l10n/po/$master.$lang.po
 [type: xml] foo/gui.xml $lang:foo/gui.$lang.xml master:file=foo-gui
 [type: xml] bar/gui.xml $lang:bar/gui.$lang.xml master:file=bar-gui

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-k>, B<--keep>

Minimal threshold for translation percentage to keep (i.e. write) the
resulting file (default: 80). I.e. by default, files have to be translated
at at least 80% to get written.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Show a short help message.

=item B<-M>, B<--master-charset>

Charset of the files containing the documents to translate. Note that all
master documents must use the same charset for now. This is a known
limitation, and we are working on solving this.

=item B<-L>, B<--localized-charset>

Charset of the files containing the localized documents. Note that all
translated documents will use the same charset for now. This is a known
limitation, and we are working on solving this.

=item B<-A>, B<--addendum-charset>

Charset of the addenda. Note that all the addenda should be in the same
charset.

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Display the version of the script and exit.

=item B<-v>, B<--verbose>

Increase the verbosity of the program.

=item B<-q>, B<--quiet>

Decrease the verbosity of the program.

=item B<-d>, B<--debug>

Output some debugging information.

=item B<-o>, B<--option>

Extra option(s) to pass to the format plugin. Specify each option in the
'I<name>B<=>I<value>' format. See the documentation of each plugin for more
information about the valid options and their meanings.

=item B<-f>, B<--force>

Always generate the POT and PO files, even if B<po4a> considers it is
not necessary.

The default behavior (when B<--force> is not specified) is the following:

=over

If the POT file already exists, it is regenerated if a master document
or the configuration file is more recent.
The POT file is also written in a temporary document and B<po4a> verifies
that the changes are really needed.

Also, a translation is regenerated only if its master document, the PO file,
one of its addenda or the configuration file is more recent.
To avoid trying to regenerate translations which do not pass the threshold
test (see B<--keep>), a file with the F<.po4a-stamp> extension can be created
(see B<--stamp>).

=back

If a master document includes files, you should use the B<--force> flag
because the modification time of these included files are not taken into
account.

The PO files are always re-generated based on the POT with B<msgmerge -U>.

=item B<--stamp>

Tells B<po4a> to create stamp files when a translation is not generated
because it does not reach the threshold. These stamp files are named
according to the expected translated document, with the F<.po4a-stamp>
extension.

Note: This only activates the creation of the F<.po4a-stamp> files. The stamp
files are always used if they exist, and they are removed with
B<--rm-translations> or when the file is finally translated.

=item B<--no-translations>

Do not generate the translated documents, only update the POT and PO files.

=item B<--rm-translations>

Remove the translated files (implies B<--no-translations>).

=item B<--no-backups>

This flag does nothing since 0.41, and may be removed
in later releases.

=item B<--rm-backups>

This flag does nothing since 0.41, and may be removed
in later releases.

=item B<--translate-only> I<translated-file>

Translate only the specified file.  It may be useful to speed up
processing if a configuration file contains a lot of files.  Note that this
option does not update PO and POT files.
This option can be used multiple times.

=item B<--variable> I<var>B<=>I<value>

Define a variable that will be expanded in the B<po4a> configuration file.
Every occurrence of I<$(var)> will be replaced by I<value>.
This option can be used multiple times.

=item B<--srcdir> I<SRCDIR>

Set the base directory for all input documents specified in the B<po4a>
configuration file.

=item B<--destdir> I<DESTDIR>

Set the base directory for all the output documents specified in the B<po4a>
configuration file.

=back

=head2 OPTIONS WHICH MODIFY POT HEADER

=over 4

=item B<porefs> I<type>[,B<wrap>|B<nowrap>]

Specify the reference format. Argument I<type> can be one of B<none> to not
produce any reference, B<noline> to not specify the line number (more
accurately all line numbers are replaced by 1), B<counter> to replace line
number by an increasing counter, and B<full> to include complete
references.

Argument can be followed by a comma and either B<wrap> or B<nowrap> keyword.
References are written by default on a single line.  The B<wrap> option wraps
references on several lines, to mimic B<gettext> tools (B<xgettext> and
B<msgmerge>).  This option will become the default in a future release, because
it is more sensible.  The B<nowrap> option is available so that users who want
to keep the old behavior can do so.

=item B<--msgid-bugs-address> I<email@address>

Set the report address for msgid bugs. By default, the created POT files
have no Report-Msgid-Bugs-To fields.

=item B<--copyright-holder> I<string>

Set the copyright holder in the POT header. The default value is
"Free Software Foundation, Inc."

=item B<--package-name> I<string>

Set the package name for the POT header. The default is "PACKAGE".

=item B<--package-version> I<string>

Set the package version for the POT header. The default is "VERSION".

=back

=head2 OPTIONS TO MODIFY PO FILES

=over 4

=item B<--msgmerge-opt> I<options>

Extra options for B<msgmerge>.

Note: B<$lang> will be extended to the current language.

=item B<--no-previous>

This option removes B<--previous> from the options passed to B<msgmerge>.
This permits to support versions of B<gettext> earlier than 0.16.

=item B<--previous>

This option adds B<--previous> to the options passed to B<msgmerge>.
It requires B<gettext> 0.16 or later, and is activated by default.

=back

=head2 EXAMPLE

Let's assume you maintain a program named B<foo> which has a man page F<man/foo.1>
which naturally is maintained in English only. Now you as the upstream or
downstream maintainer want to create and maintain the translation.
First you need to create the POT file necessary to send to translators
using L<po4a-gettextize(1)>.

So for our case we would call

 cd man && po4a-gettextize -f man -m foo.1 -p foo.pot

You would then send this file to the appropriate language lists or offer
it for download somewhere on your website.

Now let's assume you received three translations before your next release:
F<de.po> (including an addendum F<de.add>), F<sv.po> and F<pt.po>.
Since you don't want to change your F<Makefile>(s) whenever a new translation
arrives you can use B<po4a> with an appropriate configuration file in your F<Makefile>.
Let's call it F<po4a.cfg>. In our example it would look like the following:

 [po_directory] man/po4a/po/

 [type: man] man/foo.1 $lang:man/translated/$lang/foo.1 \
            add_$lang:?man/po4a/add_$lang/$lang.add opt:"-k 80"

In this example we assume that your generated man pages (and all PO and addenda
files) should be stored in F<man/translated/$lang/> (respectively in F<man/po4a/po/> and
F<man/po4a/add_$lang/>) below the current directory. In our example
the F<man/po4a/po/> directory would include F<de.po>, F<pt.po> and F<sv.po>,
and the F<man/po4a/add_de/> directory would include F<de.add>.

Note the use of the modifier B<?> as only the German translation (F<de.po>) is
accompanied by an addendum.

To actually build the translated man pages you would then (once!) add the
following line in the B<build> target of the appropriate F<Makefile>:

        po4a po4a.cfg

Once this is set up you don't need to touch the F<Makefile> when a new
translation arrives, i.e. if the French team sends you F<fr.po> and F<fr.add>
then you simply drop them respectively in F<man/po4a/po/> and
F<man/po4a/add_fr/> and the next time the programm is build the
French translation is automatically build as well in F<man/translated/fr/>.

Note that you still need an appropriate target to install localized manual
pages with English ones.

Finally if you do not store generated files into your version control system,
you will need a line in your B<clean> target as well:
        -rm -rf man/translated

/**
  This function will enumerate all possible boot devices in the system, and
  automatically create boot options for Network, Shell, Removable BlockIo, 
  and Non-BlockIo Simplefile devices. 
  
  BDS separates EFI boot options into six types:
  1. Network - The boot option points to the SimpleNetworkProtocol device. 
               Bds will try to automatically create this type of boot option during enumeration.
  2. Shell   - The boot option points to internal flash shell. 
               Bds will try to automatically create this type of boot option during enumeration.
  3. Removable BlockIo      - The boot option points to a removable media
                              device, such as a USB flash drive or DVD drive.
                              These devices should contain a *removable* blockIo
                              protocol in their device handle.
                              Bds will try to automatically create this type boot option 
                              when enumerate.
  4. Fixed BlockIo          - The boot option points to a Fixed blockIo device, 
                              such as a hard disk.
                              These devices should contain a *fixed* blockIo
                              protocol in their device handle.
                              BDS will skip fixed blockIo devices, and not
                              automatically create boot option for them. But BDS 
                              will help to delete those fixed blockIo boot options, 
                              whose description rules conflict with other auto-created
                              boot options.
  5. Non-BlockIo Simplefile - The boot option points to a device whose handle 
                              has SimpleFileSystem Protocol, but has no blockio
                              protocol. These devices do not offer blockIo
                              protocol, but BDS still can get the 
                              \EFI\BOOT\boot{machinename}.EFI by SimpleFileSystem
                              Protocol.
  6. File    - The boot option points to a file. These boot options are usually 
               created by the user, either manually or with an OS loader. BDS will not delete or modify
               these boot options.        
    
  This function will enumerate all possible boot devices in the system, and
  automatically create boot options for Network, Shell, Removable BlockIo, 
  and Non-BlockIo Simplefile devices.
  It will excute once every boot.
